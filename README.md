Repository for my site, [aaronschlegel.me](aaronschlegel.me), built with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)

### Site Theme

The current theme used on the site is a slightly modified version of [Gum](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/gum). 
The body and paragraph typeface was changed to [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) while the headers are now using the 
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) typeface.
