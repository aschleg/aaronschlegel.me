                <p>R and SQL make excellent complements for analyzing data due to their respective strengths. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/">sqldf package</a> provides an interface for working with SQL in R by querying data from a database into an R <code>data.frame</code>. This post will demonstrate how to query and analyze data using the sqldf package in conjunction with the graphing libraries <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">plotly</a> and <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> as well as some other packages that provide useful statistical tests and other functions.</p>
<p>The data that will be examined in this post is the <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-electric-utility-companies-and-rates-look-up-by-zipcode-feb-2011-57a7c">U.S. Electric Utility Companies and Rates dataset</a>, compiled by data.gov. The data is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This dataset, compiled by NREL using data from Ventyx and the U.S. Energy Information Administration dataset 861, provides average residential, commercial and industrial electricity rates by zip code for both investor owned utilities (IOU) and non-investor owned utilities. Note: the file includes average rates for each utility, but not the detailed rate structure data found in the OpenEI U.S. Utility Rate Database. A more recent version of this data is also available through the NREL Utility Rate API with more search options. This data was released by NREL/Ventyx in February 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start by loading the sqldf package and the other packages that will be used.</p>

</pre></div>


<h2>Loading the Data Using R and SQL</h2>
<p>The dataset comes in two csv files. To load the data to use with SQL, a file connection is created for each csv.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">iou</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nf">file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;../data/iouzipcodes2011.csv&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">nou</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nf">file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;../data/noniouzipcodes2011.csv&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A combined <code>data.frame</code> with both files can be created using a SQL query with the sqldf package. The two datasets are appended using the <code>UNION ALL</code> operator. Here is a link to where I found this useful method to <a href="http://www.cerebralmastication.com/2009/11/loading-big-data-into-r/">load the data into R using SQL</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">utility_df</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nf">sqldf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;SELECT * FROM iou </span>
<span class="s">                     UNION ALL </span>
<span class="s">                     SELECT * FROM nou&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dbname</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;utility_db&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To quickly test the data was loaded successfully into an R <code>data.frame</code> using the SQL query above, inspect the first five rows of the database using the following query.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">sqldf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;SELECT * FROM utility_df LIMIT 5&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This query is essentially the same as the <code>head()</code> function as seen below.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the Data with R and SQL</h2>
<p>Let's say we are interested in finding average electricity rates for each group (commercial, residential, industrial) at a state level. The following query is used to collect the desired data into an R <code>data.frame</code>. The <code>AVG()</code> aggregation used in the query as we are interested in the overall average of all utilities by state.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">state.avg.rates</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nf">sqldf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;SELECT state, AVG(comm_rate) as comm_rate, AVG(ind_rate) as ind_rate, AVG(res_rate) as res_rate  </span>

<p>The shading represents the average residential rates by state as specified in the plotting function. Several quick inferences can be made from the choropleth graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawaii and Alaska have the highest residential electricity rates by far at about .35, with Vermont next at .17. </li>
<li>Most of the Mid and Central United States average between a residential rate of 0.09 to .13.</li>
<li>Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and Tennesse have the lowest residential electricity rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The states can also be clustered using the <code>kmeans()</code> function in R and plotted with the <code>clustplot</code> function from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html">cluster</a> package. The number of clusters is set at six due to the number of ticks output from the choropleth graph (completely arbitrary and should not be done in practice, for example, purposes only). </p>

<p>The new graph is much more clear in visualizing how the average residential electricity rates differ by state. Plotting a new cluster plot with the re-queried data provides a better view of how the states are clustered.</p>

<p>As suspected from our original inferences, the states with the lowest rates (Oregon, Washington, Tennesse and Nevada) are placed in their own respective cluster. Vermont is set in its own cluster. Most of the states are arranged in clusters five and six, with mostly Northeastern states occupying separate clusters. </p>
<p>The data includes rate by the type of ownership of a particular utility. Are there any significant differences in rates depending on the type of ownership?</p>
<p>To see the different classifications of ownership, a quick query can be run.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">sqldf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;SELECT DISTINCT ownership FROM utility_df&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The query shows there are seven types of ownership classification. Let's write another query to pull the rates by state and ownership type. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ownership.rate</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nf">sqldf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;SELECT state, ownership, utility_name, </span>

<span class="s">                         FROM utility_df </span>
<span class="s">                         GROUP BY state, ownership, utility_name  </span>

<p>The plot shows most ownership classifications are similar regarding average residential electricity rates. Federal rates are by far the lowest, which could be due to these rates representing low-income housing or other federally sponsored housing projects.</p>
<p>To see if there are any significant differences between the residential rates of the ownership classifications, we can run a <a href="http://www.aaronschlegel.com/notebook/post-hoc-tests-kruskal-wallis/">Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc test</a> using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agricolae/index.html">agricolae</a> package.</p>

<p>The Kruskal-Wallis test output corresponds to the quick inferences made above on the graph. Utilities owned by Retail Power Marketers, Cooperatives and Municipalities are not significantly different from each other. State and Investor Owned utilities are not significantly distinct from the former three types and Political Subdivisions. Federally owned services are significantly different than each other ownership classification, as was expected.</p>
<h2>Further Exploration of the Data</h2>
<p>Suppose one is interested in finding the utilities with the highest residential electricity rates. We can write a query to pull this data from the database and plot. The query returns the top 20 utilities to preserve readability as specified with the <code>LIMIT</code> clause. </p>

<p>Contrary to our intuition, several states with smaller areas such as Georgia, Iowa and Tennesse are those with the most utilities.</p>
<p>Of those states in the above chart, are there significant differences in the ownership classification of the utilities?</p>

<p>Cooperative and municipal-owned utilities are the most common type of ownership in the states considered. To see the proportions of the different types of ownership, the following query can be used. The query includes all states as we are curious to see if cooperative and municipal-owned utilities are indeed representative of the majority of ownership types.</p>

<p>As one might anticipate from the previous graph, cooperative and municipal-owned utilities roughly 85% of all utilities in the United States as recorded by the dataset.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>SQL and R make a great combination when exploring and analyzing datasets using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/">sqldf package</a> package and other packages available in R. Although the dataset examined in this post was only about 5mb and therefore doesn't need to be loaded into a database for analysis, it provides a good starting point for working with SQL and R in unison. I hope to do more posts shortly using SQL and R on larger datasets.</p>
