Summary: Bartlett's test, developed by Maurice Stevenson Bartlett, is a statistical procedure for testing if $k$ population samples have equal variances. Equality of variances in population samples is assumed in commonly used comparison of means tests, such as Student's t-test and analysis of variance. Therefore, a procedure such as Bartlett's test can be conducted to accept or reject the assumption of equal variances across group samples.
