    "Bartlett's test, developed by [Maurice Stevenson Bartlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._S._Bartlett), is a statistical procedure for testing if $k$ population samples have equal variances. Equality of variances in population samples is assumed in commonly used comparison of means tests, such as [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) and [analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance). Therefore, a procedure such as Bartlett's test can be conducted to accept or reject the assumption of equal variances across group samples. \n",

    "Levene's test is an alternative to Barlett's test and is less sensitive to non-normal samples. Thus, Levene's test is generally preferred in most cases, particularly when the underlying distribution of the samples is known. Equality of variances is also known as [homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity) or homogeneity of variances.\n",

    "The [`PlantGrowth`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/datasets/PlantGrowth.html) dataset is available in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as part of its standard datasets and can also be downloaded [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/PlantGrowth.csv). After downloading the data, we load it into memory with pandas' [`read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function. Once the data is loaded, we transform the resulting `DataFrame` into a [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) array with the [`.to_numpy`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy.html) method. The first three rows of the dataset are then printed to get a sense of what the data contains. We also confirm there are indeed three sample groups in the data using numpy's [`unique`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html) function."

    "Implementing the test procedure in Python is comparatively straightforward. First, we require the total number of samples, $n$, and the number of sample groups, $k$. The number of samples can be found by indexing the first value returned from the `plants` array [`.shape`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html) method, while the number of unique groups is obtained by taking the length of the array returned by the `unique` function. We also require the total number of samples within each group and the group's variance, which we compute by grouping the `plants` array by `len` and `numpy`'s [`var`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.var.html) functions. The [`numpy-indexed`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy-indexed/) library and its `group_by` function are convenient for performing this grouping operation on `numpy` arrays."
