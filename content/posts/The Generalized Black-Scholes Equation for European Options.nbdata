Summary: Due to the number of different extensions and options on possible underlying assets, a generalized Black-Scholes model was created to simplify computations by significantly reducing the number of equations. In this post, we will explore several of the Black-Scholes option pricing models for different underlying assets and then introduce the generalized Black-Scholes pricing formula.
