Summary: Implicit differentiation can also be employed to find the derivatives of logarithmic functions, which are of the form $y = \log_a{x}$. In this post, we explore several derivatives of logarithmic functions and also prove some commonly used derivatives. The symbolic computation library SymPy is also employed to verify our answers.
