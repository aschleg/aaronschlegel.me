    "The Van der Waerden test is a non-parametric test for testing the hypothesis that $k$ sample distribution\n",

    "that it converts the data to ranks and then to standard normal distribution quantiles. The ranked data is known as the\n",
    "'normal scores'. Hence, the Van der Waerden test is sometimes referred to as a 'normal scores test'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of Van der Waerden's test is that it performs well compared to ANOVA (analysis of variance) when the\n",
    "group population samples are normally distributed and the Kruskal-Wallis test when the samples are not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
